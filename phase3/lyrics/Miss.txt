City lights are burning low
Heaven’s quiet, hearts exposed
Every step I take feels guided
Like I’m never walking alone

I was lost inside the noise
Running fast, afraid to feel
Then your voice cut through the dark
And everything became real

I don’t fight the pull anymore
I don’t doubt what this is for

I believe in us tonight
We were written in the stars
Angels watching over love
No matter how broken we are

너를 향한 이 마음은
운명처럼 멈출 수 없어
Even if the world is falling
I will run to you, forevermore

혼자였던 시간들
이제는 의미 없어
너의 이름 부르면
두려움은 사라져

I see the future in your eyes
No escape, no goodbye

We don’t hide, we don’t run
Two hearts beating as one

I believe in us tonight
We were written in the stars
Angels watching over love
Guiding us through every scar

너와 나의 이 사랑은
시간조차 멈추게 해
Even if the night is endless
I will stay, I swear

If I fall, you pull me back
If I break, you hold the cracks

어둠 속에서도
우린 서로의 빛

Heaven knows we chose this fate

We believe in us tonight
Hear the crowd, feel the fire
Angels singing from above
Lifting us higher and higher

너와 함께라면 난
두려움 없이 날아가
This love was never borrowed
This love was born to stay
