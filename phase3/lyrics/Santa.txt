Quiet nights in December
City lights glowing warm
Another year is ending
And you’re right here in my arms

They talk about gifts and wishes
Wrapped in gold and red
But everything I ever asked for
Is right here instead

I still remember that night
Red t-shirt, white shorts, just my type
Every time I close my eyes
That image makes my heart kneel

I don’t need a miracle
I don’t need a sign
Every prayer I ever made
Answered in your smile

Another Christmas together
That’s all I ever wanted
You’re the gift I always asked for
The one my heart called honest

No boxes, no price tags
No lights up in the air
My present, my forever
Is knowing you’re there

크리스마스가 와도
내가 바란 건 하나
선물이 아니라
네가 내 곁에 있는 것

빨간 옷을 입은 너
그날이 아직도 보여
내 마음속엔 항상
그 모습 그대로야

Another year, more memories
Laughing till we sleep
Every plan, every dream
Is something ours to keep

They say love fades with time
But this only feels new
Every Christmas wish I make
Still leads back to you

Another Christmas together
That’s all I ever wanted
You’re the gift I always asked for
The one my heart called honest

If the whole world goes quiet
And the lights disappear
I still have everything
As long as you’re here

Another Christmas
Same wish
You
