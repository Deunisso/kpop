Midnight lights
City breathing slow
Another year is calling
And we both already know

Another year beside you
Another chapter starts
2026 is waiting
With our keys and our hearts

We dreamed this on the floor
Making plans with nothing but faith
Now the door is almost open
And we’re right at that place

We counted days, we stayed strong
Every step we made it through
This future feels so real now
’Cause I’m walking it with you

New year, same us
Same love, no rush
Another year together
And it still feels like luck

Soon we’ll wake up
In a place that’s ours
Same bed, same dreams
Under our own stars

새해가 와도
변한 건 없어
내 옆에 네가
그대로 있어

2026
우리가 기다린 해
같은 집, 같은 하루
함께 시작해

We talked about this moment
Late nights, future talks
Now we’re closer than ever
To unlocking our door

More than walls, more than keys
It’s a life we’re building there
Every room filled with laughter
Every silence feeling safe

They say time changes everything
But this only feels more true

New year, same us
Same love, no rush
Another year together
And it still feels like luck

From planning to living
From dreams to touch
I don’t need a resolution
I just need us

이 새해의 소원은
이미 이뤄졌어
너와 함께라면
어디든 집이야

New year
New home
Same us
