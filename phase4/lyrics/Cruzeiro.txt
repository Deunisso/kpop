On that ship, the world felt slow
Blue horizons, nowhere to go
We ate whenever we had the chance
Laughing like time didn’t stand a chance
Midnight snacks, sunrise meals
Every bite made the moment real
Nothing fancy, just you and me
Lost at sea, but finally free

파도 위에서 웃고
시간을 잊은 채
작은 순간들이
사랑이 됐어

On the ocean, side by side
바다 위에서 너와 나
Music loud, lights collide
세 곡이 동시에 울려
Three songs playing, one heartbeat
혼란 속에서도 너만 보여
In the noise, I still chose you
어디서든 너를 선택해

Some nights you didn’t feel okay
The room was spinning, the smile faded away
So I stayed right there, held your hand
Didn’t need sleep, I just needed you to stand
While the ship kept moving on
I stayed with you till the pain was gone
Every night, I chose your side
Love looks like staying, not just the ride

네가 힘들어할 때
난 떠나지 않았어
밤새 곁에 있어
그게 사랑이니까

On the ocean, through the night
어두운 바다 속에서도
I watched over you, held you tight
네가 괜찮아질 때까지
Even when the waves were rough
파도가 거칠어도
I stayed, I stayed, that was love
난 너와 함께였어

여행은 풍경이 아니라
누구와 함께 있느냐야
아픈 밤도
우리에겐 추억이 돼

We ate, we laughed, we lost our way
먹고 웃고 헤매던 날들
From noisy shows to quiet rooms
시끄러운 무대부터 고요한 밤까지
On that ship, I learned the truth
그날 알게 됐어
Love is choosing you every night
사랑은 매일 밤 네 곁에 있는 것

The ocean kept moving
바다는 계속 흘렀고
But my place was right there
내 자리는 너였어
