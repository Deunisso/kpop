The air was cold
But she felt warm with you
Your hands, your voice, your presence
Turned winter into home

My love always loved
The potato salad you made
Every bite was comfort
Every taste, a safe place

The day we came to visit
She went to sit down
You smiled and said
“That chair is for you” — for me

And in that moment
I knew why she loved you so
Your heart was open
Like you already knew me

네 곁에 있으면
그녀는 금방 잠이 들었어
네 침대에 누우면
아무 걱정도 없었어

할머니 품 안에서
그녀는 늘 편안했어
그 사랑이
그녀를 안아줬어

It was so hard to see you there
Hospital lights, quiet fear
But we tried to make you smile
Even just a little, even through tears

We held your hand together
Did the best we could do
You were tired, but still gentle
Still loving us too

그녀는 널 정말 많이 사랑해
지금도 변함없이
말로 다 못 한 마음이
조용히 남아 있어

She painted your nails
So carefully, every time
Like she was holding on
To moments frozen in time

You made her so happy
In ways she’ll never forget
And every part of who she is
Still carries you in it

네가 없다는 건 아프지만
사랑은 사라지지 않아
그녀 안에 남아서
지금도 숨 쉬고 있어

She loves you so much
That will never change
You’re in her laugh, her silence
In every ordinary day

Always warm
Always loved
Always with her
