At night my chest gets heavy
Thoughts won’t let me sleep
I don’t know how to say it
Everything’s too deep

Sometimes my heart runs faster
No reason, just fear
The room feels smaller
Even when you’re here

I shake, I lose my breath
I don’t want answers now
I just don’t wanna be alone

When the silence gets loud
You don’t ask why

I feel it when your body tenses
Middle of the night
I pull you closer, hold you tighter
Till the fear lets go its fight

I don’t rush your feelings
I stay, arms around you
Till your heart slows down

I don’t need you calm
I need you here

When your mind starts racing
I don’t let you fall
If the world feels like it’s closing in
I become your wall
You don’t need to explain it
I’m here till the end

밤이 올 때마다
불안이 날 안아
말하지 않아도
네 품이 필요해

I thought you needed distance
So I stepped away
But I learned too late
You just wanted me to stay

So I come back closer
I won’t disappear
I listen more than I speak
I want you to feel me here

멀어지려 했던 건
널 위한 거라 믿었어
이제 알아
네가 원한 건
내 품이란 걸

Through the panic, through the night
Just you and me, no fight
When you break, I won’t run
This is how we love

Hold me here
I’m not leaving
