Tick tock
Yeah
Time’s on my side

Time moves fast, I lose control
Days spin inside my soul
I try to run, I try to hide
But every clock leads to your side

June first, carved in stone
That’s the day we made a home

I don’t wanna waste a second
Every moment feels like fate
If tomorrow breaks the pattern
I’ll still choose you, I’ll still wait

I wanna live all my time with you
Every hour feels brand new
Mind goes crazy, heart stays true
Time bends when I’m with you

Living in a time loop
Only me and you

September twenty-three
That’s when you got a hold of me
Two years, three months gone
But my love keeps ticking on

Seconds fall, days collide
You’re my future, you’re my now
Past and present intertwine
Every memory feels alive
If the clock starts breaking down
I’ll stay here, no way out

I wanna live all my time with you
Every hour feels brand new
Mind goes crazy, heart stays true
Time bends when I’m with you

Living in a time loop
Only me and you

If the world resets tonight
I’d find you every time
No beginning, no goodbye
You’re my forever timeline

너의 시간 속에
난 멈춰 있어

I wanna live all my time with you
No rewind, no substitute
Years go wild, love stays true
My forever starts with you

Stuck inside this time loop
Forever me and you

Tick tock
Still with you
