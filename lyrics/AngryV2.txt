Yeah
I’m not backing off

You feel things deeper than most
Pressure hits, you’re on overload
Voice gets sharp, world gets loud
I don’t flinch, I don’t step out

I see fire in the way you react
But I know there’s more than that

When your patience runs too thin
And emotions crash within
I don’t tell you to change your tone
I stay

You go hard, you go fast
When it hits, it hits like that
I don’t run, I don’t fold
I stay calm, I stay close

You’re intense, I understand
Every feeling in your hand
When the world makes you lose control
I’m the calm that brings you home

I know anger’s not your name
It’s just your heart feeling the weight
You carry more than what you say
That’s why I don’t walk away

I don’t need you soft or slow
I just need you to know

네 감정이 복잡해도
난 이해하려 해
화를 내도
난 여기 있어

You go hard, you go fast
When it breaks, when it cracks
I don’t push, I don’t blame
I stay calm inside the flames

You don’t scare me when you’re tense
I don’t lose my patience
When your storm gets out of control
I’m the calm that brings you home

I don’t fix, I don’t fight
I don’t tell you you’re not right
I just breathe when you can’t
And I hold you where you stand

완벽하지 않아도
괜찮아
네 모든 감정까지
사랑해

Let it burn, let it shake
I’m still here, I don’t break
You can scream, you can feel
I’m not leaving, this is real

Strong or messy, loud or low
Every side of you I know
When the world won’t understand
I will

Breathe
I got you
