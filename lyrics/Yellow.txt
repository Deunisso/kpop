Yeah
Still falling

Red lips first sight my world went slow
I lost my words my heart said go
I asked your name my hands were cold
That first moment took control

From that second I was gone
Every thought kept moving on

I walk alone inside my head
Too many words I never said
Crowded mind but one clear view
Every road still leads to you

I’m falling down inside my mind
Losing days losing time
But when I break when I fall
You’re the voice that hears my call

I’m stuck inside these memories
They keep pulling back to you
My mind’s a mess but you’re the truth

First date wheels on shaky ground
Holding hands no balance found
Laughing loud trying to hide
How my heart was terrified

Late night bars hands on skin
Crowded rooms just pulling in
Train rides photos out of frame
Said it’s good laughed all the same

Every place becomes the same
If I see your face again
Even noise fades to a sound
When your head’s on me I’m calm
I’m falling down inside my mind
Losing days losing time
But when I break when I fall
You’re the voice that hears my call

Every memory plays you back
Like my thoughts don’t know escape
My mind chose you that’s a fact

너를 처음 본 순간부터
내 생각은 멈춘 적 없어
웃음 하나 눈빛 하나
전부 마음속에 남아

어디를 가도 네가 보여
조용해도 네가 들려
내 머릿속 내 하루 끝
항상 너로 가득 차

Music loud arms around you
Charlie Brown playing through
Crowded night but I was calm
Every fear felt far and gone

You fell asleep on my shoulder
I stayed still held you closer
That’s when my mind understood
Trust feels heavy trust feels good

I’m still falling inside my head
But with you I’m not dead
Every thought keeps pulling through
Every memory leads to you

If my mind’s a broken place
You’re the calm you’re the grace
My head chose you from the start

Still falling
But not alone
