Yeah
Smooth like us

World keeps spinning, days fly by
Different lights, another sky
People change, moments fade
But you stay the same

I don’t need forever loud
I just need you here right now

Every road I ever choose
Every version, every move
If I’m asked what feels like home
It’s you

The world can change, the time can pass
I keep choosing you like that
Every day, every phase
I choose you anyway

I can love you all the time
Morning sun to late-night shine
If love’s a rhythm, love’s a groove
I stay in step with you

No need drama, no disguise
I see truth in your eyes
When it’s hard, when it’s easy
You’re my constant

People talk, seasons move
Still my heart runs back to you

시간이 흘러가도
내 선택은 너야
어제도 오늘도
항상 너야

The world can change, the time can pass
I keep choosing you like that
Every smile, every fight
Still you’re my right

I can love you all the time
Every beat, every line
If love’s a rhythm, love’s a move
I stay in step with you

No rush, no fear
I’m already here
Wherever life decides to go
I know

The world can change, the time can pass
I keep choosing you like that
Not by chance, not by fate
It’s a choice I make

I can love you all the time
Every season, every night
If love’s a rhythm, love’s the truth
I dance through life with you

Yeah
Always you
