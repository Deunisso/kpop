Yeah
Feel the light

From the first time our eyes met
Something deeper called my name
Not a thought, not a sign
Just my soul saying “stay”

Every step felt soft and true
Like my heart already knew
No reason, no control
Just soul to soul

When you’re near, I feel complete
Like my breath finally fits
No fear here, no disguise
You touch places words can’t find

Soul to soul, we connect
No beginning, no regret
I don’t need to understand
My soul reached for your hand

Soul to soul, shining through
Everything feels warm and new
If love lives deep inside
That’s where you and I collide

Every smile feels like home
Every silence feels full
I don’t question what we are
I just feel it in my soul

When you laugh, something heals
When you’re close, everything’s real
No promises, no role
Just soul to soul

No past weight, no future fear
Only now when you are here
Every beat, every sigh
Feels like souls aligned

Soul to soul, we connect
No beginning, no regret
I don’t need to understand
My soul reached for your hand

Soul to soul, shining through
Everything feels warm and new
If love lives deep inside
That’s where you and I collide

너의 눈을 처음 본 순간
말없이 마음이 알아
이유 없이 끌렸던 건
영혼이 먼저 느낀 거야

시간도 생각도 없이
그저 너라는 존재
내 영혼이 네게 닿아
조용히 안긴 것뿐

Soul to soul, we belong
No right place, no wrong
If forever has a sound
It’s our hearts beating now

Soul to soul, you and me
This is love, honestly
Not the mind, not control
Just soul to soul

Soul to soul
We’re already home
