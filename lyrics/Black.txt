Silence
When you’re not here

The room feels wrong
Without you here
I move, I breathe
But you’re not near

Time keeps going
I stay behind

I talk, I smile
I play my role
But everything
Feels half, not whole

This is the void
You leave in me
Not empty
Just too deep

I’m here, I’m fine
That’s what I say
But every night
Feels one step away

I save my words
For when you’re back
Every thought
Still knows your path
Joy feels low
When you’re gone

하루는 흐르는데
나는 멈춰 있어
네가 없는 시간은
의미가 없어

This is the void
I carry around
Every sound
Misses your sound

I don’t fall
I don’t break
I just wait

멀리 있어도
너는 여기 있어
말 없어도
느껴져

This is the void
But not the end
I’m incomplete
Until you’re here

Come back
This place remembers you
