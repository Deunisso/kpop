Yeah
Look at you now

You became my reality
Standing right in front of me
Every step you shine so bright
You turn my days into gold light

Sweet power in the way you move
Every room makes space for you

No doubt, no fear, no fall
You don’t need to try at all
Every time you smile my way
The whole world fades away

How you like that?
You’re my real life dream
Queen energy, shining clean
How you like that?
You’re my everything

That smile, the most beautiful in the world
Those curls, every move they glow
You’re my woman, loud and proud
This is real love, say it out loud

이게 바로 현실이야
너와 내가 서 있는 자리
모든 순간이 빛나
너는 나의 전부야

Strong and gentle, side by side
You carry love with so much pride
Every look, you dominate
You don’t wait — you elevate

You don’t need a crown to rule
You’re the definition of cool

Every moment feels so clear
With you, the future’s here
No “maybe”, no disguise
This is truth before my eyes

How you like that?
You’re my real life dream
Queen energy, shining clean
How you like that?
You’re my everything

That smile, the most beautiful in the world
Those curls, every move they glow
You’re my woman, loud and proud
This is real love, say it out loud

우린 사랑했고
약속했고
함께 여기까지 왔어
이건 꿈이 아냐

오늘도 내일도
너와 함께라면
이게 바로 현실이야
내가 선택한 사랑

How you like that?
This is real, not pretend
From the start until the end
How you like that?
You’re my forever then

My woman, my reality
My present, my destiny
This is real love, no cap
How you like that?

Yeah
That’s my reality
