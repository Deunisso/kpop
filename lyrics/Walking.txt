We were chasing the sky that day
Sun on fire, no place to hide
Road was long, my breath was short
But you were right here by my side

Steps were heavy, time stood still
Heat on skin, but hearts awake
Every laugh broke through the noise
Every doubt began to shake

We were heading for the high line
Dreams hanging in the air
Crowds so loud, the wait endless
So we turned back, didn’t care

Walking back under burning light
Feet were tired, will still strong
When the plan fell into pieces
That’s when everything felt right

너무 뜨거웠던 그 날의 길
숨이 차도 멈추지 않아
돌아가는 그 발걸음마다
우리의 진심이 남아

줄이 길어 하늘은 멀어졌고
꿈은 잠시 뒤로 갔지만
네 옆에 있는 이 순간은
아무것도 바꿀 수 없어

We didn’t fly like we planned to
But love was already moving
Every step back next to you
Felt higher than we were losing

If the world says “not today”
I won’t call it a defeat
Some dreams wait for another time
But you never leave my feet

힘들었던 그 돌아오는 길
그래도 난 후회 없어
극한 속에서 깨달은 건
너와 함께라는 이유

Even in the heat, even in the slow
Even when we turned around
That long walk back, side by side
Was the moment we were found

If I had to choose again
The road, the sun, the pain
I’d walk it all the same
As long as it’s you with me
