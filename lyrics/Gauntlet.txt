Yeah
Infinite mode on
This is our world now

Everywhere I go, I’m not alone
Where you stand feels like home
No coordinates, no control
Your side is my zone

어디에 있어도
너와 함께라면
이 공간의 중심은
언제나 우리야

You live inside my head
Every word you never said
Silence talks, I understand
One look, you know who I am

머릿속에 너의 이름
지워지지 않아
생각 끝에 남아 있는 건
항상 너야

This ain’t a dream, this is real
I can touch it, I can feel
Standing strong, look at us now
This is love, no cap, no doubt

Queen right here, shining loud
Every step, you own the ground
This is real, say it proud
Infinite love, here and now

When I fall, you pull me up
When I break, you make me tough
No fear left, I stand my ground
Your name’s the strength I found

너의 이름 하나로
다시 일어서
이 힘의 근원은
항상 너야
Seconds run, years collide
Every timeline picks your side
Past, present, future too
Every time leads back to you

시간이 흘러도
변하지 않아
처음부터 끝까지
너와 나야

This is real, this is strong
We survived, we moved on
Every second makes us loud
Infinite love, here and now

From the start until the end
I choose you again and again
No rewind, no escape
This is fate, this is us

Not the mind, not the fight
Just your soul next to mine
I don’t question, I just know
My soul found its home

영혼이 먼저 알아
말없이 닿아
이 사랑의 깊이는
설명 못 해

Space, mind, time collide
Power rising, real inside
Soul to soul, side by side
Infinite mode, we don’t hide

This is us, loud and true
Every universe chose you
All the stones, one design
Infinite love, infinite life

Infinite mode on
You’re my everything
