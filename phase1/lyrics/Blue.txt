Yeah
Here I stand

Everywhere I go, I feel you near
Different cities, same atmosphere
Crowds around, lights above
But my place is where you are

No map needed, no direction
Your side is my location

I don’t chase, I don’t hide
I stand tall with you by my side
Where I am, I’m complete
Every step lands on my feet

This is my space, I own my ground
Where you are, I’m never lost
Every room, every town
I belong, no matter where I’m found

I shine loud, I take my place
Universe moves when I say my name
My space, my truth
My place is you

From the start, I knew my role
I don’t shrink, I take it all
Eyes on me, I don’t bend
I’m myself, no pretend

Different roads, same direction
You and me, no correction

I don’t need to fit a frame
I’m enough just as I am
When I stand, when I move
I’m aligned when I’m with you

This is my space, I own my ground
Where you are, I’m never lost
Every room, every town
I belong, no matter where I’m found

I shine loud, I take my place
Universe moves when I say my name
My space, my truth
My place is you

어디에 있어도
나는 나로 서 있어
네가 있는 그곳이
내가 머무는 자리야

시선 속에서도
흔들리지 않아
이 공간의 중심은
언제나 너와 나

This is my space, no fear, no doubt
I’m here now, hear me out
I don’t fade, I don’t lose
I exist, I choose my truth

My space, my flame
I rise every time
My place is you

Stand tall
This is my space
