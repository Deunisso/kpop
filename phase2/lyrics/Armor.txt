I learned to breathe behind the steel
Quiet heart, nothing real

I never knew how to say it out loud
I kept my feelings underground
Every smile, carefully worn
I hid my truth inside the storm

I looked fearless, I looked strong
But I stayed silent for too long

I hid my heart, I locked the door
Didn’t know how to show you more
Then you looked straight through my frame
And nothing stayed the same

For you, I took my armor off
Let you see it all
Every fear, every flaw
I don’t fight it anymore

I was built to never bend
Never break, never show
But loving you
Made me let go

I struggled just to demonstrate
Every feeling came too late
Words would fail, hands would freeze
I didn’t know how to let you see

항상 감정을 숨겼던 나
표현하는 게 너무 어려웠어
근데 너 앞에서는
더 이상 숨고 싶지 않아

For you, I laid my weapons down
No disguise, no crown
If this love makes me exposed
I choose that now

I don’t need to look invincible
I don’t need control
All I need is you
Knowing my soul

너를 위해
모든 갑옷을 벗었어
강해 보이던 나보다
진짜 나를 보여줄게

I was never good at showing pain
Or saying what I feel
But loving you
Made me real

Heart unguarded, standing bare
No steel between us here
If I’m brave for the first time
It’s because you’re near

이제는
너 앞에서는
숨기지 않아
