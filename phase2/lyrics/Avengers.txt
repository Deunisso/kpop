Just us
Before the day begins
No noise, no rush
Just breathing in

Same bed, same side
Soft lights, sleepy eyes
You fall asleep so easily
I follow right behind

The world can wait outside
While we stay here
Every night feels lighter
When you’re near

I used to doubt everything
But not this, not you
Every step makes sense
When I’m next to you

If the world breaks again
I won’t hesitate
Not because I’m strong
But because it’s you I choose

One world left, just us
Nothing left to prove
If everything fades away
I still choose you

They said we moved too fast
Didn’t know our names
But love doesn’t slow down
When it’s real that way

Plans made early, hands held tight
Not fear, just certainty
We didn’t rush the future
We believed

Every doubt fell quiet
When you said “I’m here”

If the world breaks again
I won’t hesitate
Not because I’m strong
But because it’s you I choose

One world left, just us
Nothing left to prove
If everything fades away
I still choose you

같은 침대
같은 하루의 끝
조용한 밤에
너와 나뿐인 순간

서두른 게 아니라
확신이었어
처음부터
우린 알았어

I don’t need a perfect life
I just need this view
Waking up and realizing
It’s always you

영웅일 필요 없어
대단할 필요도 없어
네 옆에 있으면
그걸로 충분해

One world left, me and you
Quiet love, steady truth
If tomorrow disappears
I’m still right here with you

Born for each other
That’s not a line
It’s every morning
Every night

One world left
Us
