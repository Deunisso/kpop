Tonight I found my home in your eyes
All the words I never said
Are dancing slowly in my head
You’re the reason my heart still believes
You’re the quiet in my broken seas
You’re the love I was afraid to need
And every time you hold my hand
Right here, the world begins again
All I want is you, until the end

너의 숨결 속에서 나는 쉬어
이 순간이 영원이라면 좋겠어

Time slows down when you’re close to me
All my fears begin to fade
As your light pulls me from the shade
You are every dream I couldn’t name
You are shelter when it rains
You are hope running through my veins
And I don’t need to understand
Right now, your love is where I stand
Always yours — forever planned

너는 강해서 아름답고
부드러워서 더 빛나
세상이 아무리 흔들려도
나는 너를 선택할 거야
지금도, 그리고 앞으로의 모든 날에도
너와 함께라면
나는 영원히 살고 싶어
