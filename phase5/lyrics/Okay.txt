I know this isn’t how you planned
I see the weight you’re holding in your hands
Sometimes life bends the wrong way
Even when we’re trying our best to stay straight
You look at yourself with blame-filled eyes
Like one mistake erased your light
But listen close, I need you to hear
This moment doesn’t end you here

지금의 아픔이
너를 정의하진 않아
넘어진 자리에서
다시 일어날 뿐이야

It’s okay, you’re allowed to fall
괜찮아, 멈춰도 돼
This mistake won’t break you down
이게 전부는 아니야
You’re learning, growing, moving on
배우고 있는 중이야
And I’m right here, not going anywhere
난 네 곁에 있어
