You think you know everything about me?
Listen closer.

When I was a kid, I chewed the world raw
Started with my flaws, didn’t know the law
Laugh it off now, but it shaped my skin
Every strange habit was survival within
Had a pet rat back in the condo days
Learned early love comes in different ways
Straightened my hair just to try to belong
In a place that was never built for my song

웃음 뒤에 숨긴 상처들
작아지라던 말들
그래도 난 여기 있어
난 아직 서 있어

THIS IS ME — NO FILTER, NO SHAME
SCARS SPEAK LOUDER THAN THE NAMES
I FELL, I BROKE, I ROSE AGAIN
TURNED ALL THE PAIN INTO FLAME
THIS IS ME — I WON’T HIDE
THE PAST DON’T OWN ME, I DECIDE
FROM LAUGHTER TO SCREAMS INSIDE
THIS IS MY LIFE — I SURVIVED

가지? 튀긴 것만, 규칙은 필요 없어
어릴 적 트라우마는 아직도 남아서
우유는 못 마셔, 기억이 날 때마다
목에 걸린 과거가 날 붙잡아
Black lipstick, gothic nights
Blonde hair, changing lives
“I love Justin Bieber” on my chest
Still here, still breathing, fuck your test

비웃어
판단해
부숴도
난 자라
난 자라

First big book taught me how to laugh
Next ones taught me how to fight back
Bought too many books, lost the count
My mind’s too loud to ever shut down
Music saved me back in seventeen
When the world was colder than it seemed
Between the noise, the blood, the sound
I found my ground

THIS IS ME — NO APOLOGY
이게 나야, 숨기지 않아
I TURNED THE CHAOS INTO ME
고통 속에서 나를 찾았어
THIS IS ME — LOOK AT ME NOW
난 여기까지 살아왔어
AND IN THIS HELL I FINALLY SEE
세상에서 제일 좋은 남편과 함께

너는 다 안다고 생각했겠지
하지만 이건
시작일 뿐이야
