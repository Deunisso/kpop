I’ve walked through the dark before
This time I don’t walk alone
어둠은 익숙했지만
이제 혼자가 아냐

I built these walls with my own hands
Called it strength, called it control
But every night the cracks would grow
And I felt myself losing hold
I tried to drown the noise inside
Buried truth beneath my skin
But you stood there, unafraid
And pulled me back from where I’d been
그 어떤 밤에도
넌 등을 돌리지 않았어

When my faith was paper-thin
When I couldn’t face myself
You didn’t save me from the fall
You taught me how to stand
무너진 순간에도
넌 나를 믿었어

I carry the fire, I carry the flame
Born from the hurt, baptized in pain
When I’m breaking, when I’m tired
You remind me who I am
I carry the fire, carved in my bones
Through blood and fear, I’m not alone
If I rise, if I survive
It’s because you never ran
이 불은 꺼지지 않아
내 안에서 타올라

I’ve seen the edge, I’ve felt the cold
Heard every voice say “let it go”
But when my knees hit the ground
Your name was the only sound
I’m not healed, I’m not whole
Still learning how to let it show
But every scar, every tear
Is proof I’m still here
끝없는 싸움 속에서도
넌 내 곁에 있었어

When the night refuses dawn
When the fight feels never done
I don’t need a perfect ending
Just your hand until it comes
부서진 나의 심장도
다시 뛰게 만든 건 너야

I carry the fire, I carry the flame
Born from the hurt, baptized in pain
When I’m breaking, when I’m tired
You remind me who I am
I carry the fire, carved in my bones
Through blood and fear, I’m not alone
If I rise, if I survive
It’s because you never ran

Let the world burn, let it fall
I’ve faced the worst, I’ve lost it all
If this is the price of light
I’ll pay it every time
I was ash, I was smoke
I was ready to let go
But you breathed life into me
And turned my wounds to gold

So if my voice shakes tonight
If my hands still fear the fight
I’ll step forward through the flame
Say your name, and stand my ground
너와 함께라면
난 끝까지 간다

I carry the fire, I carry the flame
Not as a curse, but as my name
When I’m breaking, when I’m tired
You remind me who I am
I carry the fire, bright and wild
For the broken, for the child
If I rise, if I survive
It’s because you never ran

이 불은 꺼지지 않아
너로 인해 타올라
Even at the end of nights
I carry the fire.
